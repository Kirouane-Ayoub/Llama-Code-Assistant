# Llama-Code Assistant

## About This Project :
**Llama Code Assistant** is a powerful tool built upon a massive 34-billion-parameter generative text model. This model, available in the Hugging Face Transformers format, is designed for various code-related tasks, including code synthesis and comprehension. It serves as a valuable resource for developers and programmers by assisting them in writing, understanding, and generating code.


## Code Llama : 
Code Llama is a collection of pre-trained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 34 billion parameters. This is the repository for the 34B instruct-tuned version in the Hugging Face Transformers format. This model is designed for general code synthesis and understanding. Links to other models can be found in the index at the bottom. **https://huggingface.co/codellama/CodeLlama-34b-Instruct-hf**

## CodeLlama 34B Instruct - GGUF : 

**CodeLlama 34B Instruct** is available in the **GGUF** format, which is a new format introduced by the **llama.cpp** team in **August 2023**. **GGUF** is a replacement for **GGML**, which is no longer supported by **llama.cpp**. The key benefit of **GGUF** is that it is an extensible, future-proof format that stores more information about the model as metadata. It also includes significantly improved tokenization code, including for the first time full support for special tokens.**https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/CodeLlama-34B-Instruct-GGUF**
